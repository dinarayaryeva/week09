Simple 5-page case and 2 sequences with the same numbers:
1 - miss
2 - miss
3 - miss
4 - miss
5 - miss
6 - miss + swap
1 - miss + swap
2 - miss + swap
3 - miss + swap
4 - miss + swap
5 - miss + swap
100% miss because number of input pages is biger than page frame number, also sequence is constructed in such a way that the next reference points to the least used/never used page.
1 - miss
2 - miss
3 - miss
4 - miss
5 - miss
6 - miss
5 - hit
4 - hit
3 - hit
2 - hit
1 - miss + swap
63% miss that is mostly only miss because of the new page id initialization(only 1 swap),the sequence is constructed in such a manner that the next reference points to the least recently used page most of the time.
